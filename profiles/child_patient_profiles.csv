Tyler,7,Tyler is a second grader who has been struggling with concentration at school and has frequent meltdowns in the evenings. His mom says he often uses a tablet or watches cartoons for several hours after school while she cooks or finishes work emails. Tyler has trouble falling asleep and rarely gets outside to play on weekdays. His pediatrician is concerned about the impact of screen time on his sleep and behavior.
Ava,10,Ava has gained weight over the past year and now complains of knee pain and feeling winded during PE. Her dad says she mostly stays inside after school playing video games or watching YouTube while he works from home. Weekends are often spent indoors as well and the family eats out several times a week. Ava says she misses playing tag and bike riding but doesn’t have much time or space to do those things.
Malik,5,Malik has been waking up cranky and groggy and his preschool teacher notes that he seems sleepy in class. His bedtime routine is inconsistent—sometimes he falls asleep with the TV on and other times he stays up late playing on a tablet. His mom says bedtime is a daily struggle and screens help calm him down but she’s starting to wonder if they’re doing more harm than good.
